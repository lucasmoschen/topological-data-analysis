Abstract
---

This is a topic from applied mathematics with the objective of analyze datasets using techiniques from topology. This framework is insensitive to a particular metric and provides dimensionality reduction and robustness to noise. In this course, we aim to understand the basic topologic concepts as topological space and apply it using Python.
